|siSTR overview|

(Under development)

siSTR consists of the following subcommands:

* `sistr index`: build ABC and LRT lookup tables needed to run other siSTR commands
* `sistr score`: run siSTR to compute selection coefficients at individual STRs based on population allele frequencies
* `sistr joint`: infer siSTR models jointly across loci (SISTR2 method) ()
