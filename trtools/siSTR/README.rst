|SISTR overview|

(Under development)

SISTR consists of the following subcommands:

* :code:`sistr index`: build ABC and LRT lookup tables needed to run other siSTR commands
* :code:`sistr score`: run siSTR to compute selection coefficients at individual STRs based on population allele frequencies
* :code:`sistr joint`: infer siSTR models jointly across loci (SISTR2 method) ()
