|siSTR overview|

(Under development)

siSTR consists of the following subcommands:

* `siSTR index`: build ABC and LRT lookup tables needed to run other siSTR commands
* `siSTR score`: run siSTR to compute selection coefficients at individual STRs based on population allele frequencies
* `siSTR joint`: infer siSTR models jointly across loci (SISTR2 method) ()
