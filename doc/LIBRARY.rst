Python Library
==============

The TRHarmonizer python library underlies all of the TRTools command line tools 
and can be used independently of them. See :doc:`here <LIBRARY_OVERVIEW>` for a description
of what that library does. See :doc:`here <CODE_EXAMPLES>` for examples on how to use
it in your own code. See :doc:`here <LIBRARY_SPEC>` for specifics on how TRHarmonizer parses
the outputs of different genotypers. And see :doc:`here <API>` for the API of 
the python code of both the TRHarmonizer library and the command-line tools.
