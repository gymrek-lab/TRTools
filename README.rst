TRTools includes a variety of utilities for filtering, quality control and analysis of tandem repeats downstream of genotyping them from next-generation sequencing. It supports multiple recent genotyping tools (see below).

See full documentation and examples at https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Install
-------

You can install TRTools with conda::

        conda install -c bioconda trtools

Note: Bioconda only supports python versions 3.6 and 3.7 currently,
so that is all TRTools supports in conda.
If you are using a different version of python we support (3.5 or >= 3.8),
install TRTools using pip.

You can alternatively obtain TRTools from pip::

        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install trtools

(Note: trtools installation may fail for pip version 10.0.1, hence the need to upgrade pip first)

To install from source (only recommended for development) download the TRTools repository from `github <https://github.com/gymreklab/TRTools/>`_,
checkout the branch you're interested in, and run the following command from the base directory of the repo. e.g.::

        git clone https://github.com/gymreklab/TRTools
        cd TRTools/
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .

(Note, required package :code:`pybedtools` requires zlib. If you receive an error about a missing file :code:`zlib.h`, you can install on Ubuntu using :code:`sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev` or CentOS using :code:`sudo yum install zlib-devel`.)

Tools
-----
TRTools includes the following tools.

* `mergeSTR <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/mergeSTR.html>`_: a tool to merge VCF files across multiple samples genotyped using the same tool
* `dumpSTR <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/dumpSTR.html>`_: a tool for filtering VCF files with TR genotypes
* `qcSTR <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/qcSTR.html>`_: a tool for generating various quality control plots for a TR callset
* `statSTR <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/statSTR.html>`_: a tool for computing various statistics on VCF files
* `compareSTR <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/compareSTR.html>`_: a tool for comparing TR callsets

Type :code:`<command> --help` to see a full set of options.

It additionally includes a python library, :code:`trtools`, which can be accessed from within Python scripts. e.g.::

        import trtools.utils.utils as stls
        allele_freqs = {5: 0.5, 6: 0.5} # 50% of alleles have 5 repeat copies, 50% have 6
        stls.GetHeterozygosity(allele_freqs) # should return 0.5

Usage
-----

We recommend new users start with the example commands described in the `command-line interface for each tool <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UTILITIES.html>`_.
We also suggest going through our `vignettes <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/VIGNETTES.html>`_ that walk through some example workflows using TRTools.

Supported TR Callers
--------------------
TRTools supports VCFs from the following TR genotyping tools:

* AdVNTR_
* ExpansionHunter_
* GangSTR_ version 2.4 or higher
* HipSTR_
* PopSTR_ version 2 or higher

See our description of the `features and example use-cases <https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CALLERS.html>`_ of each of these tools.

Development Notes
-----------------

* TRTools only currently supports diploid genotypes. Haploid calls, such as those on male chrX or chrY, are not yet supported but should be coming soon.
* TRTools currently works on top of the `PyVCF <http://pyvcf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library. We plan in a future release to move to `cyvcf2 <https://github.com/brentp/cyvcf2>`_.


Contributing
------------
We appreciate contributions to TRTools. If you would like to contribute a fix or new feature, follow these guidelines:

1. Consider `discussing <https://github.com/gymreklab/TRTools/issues>`_ your solution with us first so we can provide help or feedback if necessary.
#. Create a clean environment with the dependencies in requirements.txt installed.
#. Additionally, install :code:`pytest`, `pytest-cov <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pytest-cov>`_ and :code:`sphinx>=3` in your environment.
#. Fork the trtools repository. 
#. The :code:`develop` branch contains the latest pre-release codebase. Create a branch off of :code:`develop` titled with the name of your feature.
#. Make your changes. 
#. Document your changes.

  * Ensure all functions, modules, classes etc. conform to `numpy docstring standards <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_.

    If applicable, update the REAMDEs in the directories of the files you changed with new usage information.

  * If you have added significant amounts of new documentation then build the documentation locally to ensure it looks good.

    :code:`cd` to the :code:`doc` directory and run :code:`make clean && make html`, then view :code:`doc/_build/html/index.html` and navigate from there

8. Add tests to test any new functionality. Add them to the :code:`tests/` folder in the directory of the code you modified.

  * :code:`cd` to the root of the project and run :code:`python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing` to make sure that (1) all tests pass and (2) any code you have added is covered by tests. (Code coverage may **not** go down).

9. Submit a pull request **to the develop branch** of the central repository with a description of what changes you have made.
   A member of the TRTools team will reply and continue the contribution process from there, possibly asking for additional information/effort on your part.
